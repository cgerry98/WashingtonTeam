Food Desert in Washington Neighborhood, Long Beach,Ca


This is part of the CSULB project Team's Data Science Group. Aim to aid the nonprofit "Books & Buckets" located in Long Beach, Ca with their mission of addressing the challenges and needs of young people growing up in the Washington Neighborhood.

In this project what was worked on was testing to see if if the Washington neighborhood was a food desert. One of the contributing factors of a food dessert according to USDA's article, Mapping Food Deserts in the United States, 

"Census tracts qualify as food deserts if they meet low-income and low-access thresholds:

Low-income: a poverty rate of 20 percent or greater, or a median family income at or below 80 percent of the statewide or metropolitan area median family income;
Low-access: at least 500 persons and/or at least 33 percent of the population lives more than 1 mile from a supermarket or large grocery store (10 miles, in the case of rural census tracts).
Data on population and income come from the 2000 Census of Population and Housing" (Ploeg, 2011).

So we would need to simulate 500 random points in the region to make a statement that the region is a food desert.

We found out the average distance of the 500 residents are within 1 mile of a grocery store making the neighborhood a non food desert area.
